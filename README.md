# Sight Words Bingo

## Overview

This is a simple bingo game for sight words. The words are hardcoded for now since the game is intended for my family only.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
