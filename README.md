# Sight Words Bingo

## Overview

This is a simple bingo game for sight words. The words are hardcoded for now since the game is intended for my family only.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## TODOs

- When printing, put in alphabetical order
- Make the board centered in the screen
- Maybe: have the printing be on the screen, with a toggle to show/hide

## Getting Started Locally

```bash
# clone the repo
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
